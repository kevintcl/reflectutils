	<name>reflectutils</name>
	<comment>A set of reflection utilities and miscellaneous utilities related to working with classes and their fields with no dependencies which is compatible with java 1.5 and generics.
        The package was originally created by Aaron Zeckoski for the Sakai Project and Generic DAO
        project but was repackaged to make it distributable by request. It is used in the
        RSF framework (http://www2.caret.cam.ac.uk/rsfwiki/) and the EntityBroker among other things. Note about the BeanUtils
        provided dependency: BeanUtils is not required if you are not using it in your
        project. Note about the Hibernate provided dependency: Hibernate is not required
        if you are not using it in your project.</comment>
